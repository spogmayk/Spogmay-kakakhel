<!-- ABOUT -->
<section class="about" id="about">
  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <p>
  <p>I am an aspiring bug bounty hunter with a strong foundation in web application and network security. I have worked extensively in controlled lab environments such as PortSwigger Web Security Academy, CEH labs, and TryHackMe, where I actively tested applications for real world security flaws.</p>
<p>My core expertise includes web application security testing, vulnerability assessment, and network security analysis. I have practical experience identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), access control issues (IDOR), command injection, authentication flaws, and business logic vulnerabilities, keeping a methodical and ethical testing approach.</p>
<p>I have completed the CEH coursework and continue to strengthen my skills through hands on labs and practical security projects, with a strong focus on real world attack scenarios and defensive understanding. </p>
<p>I’m interested in working on academic, final year and any other cybersecurity projects focused on web application and system security, and vulnerability analysis, delivered with clear reports and detailed documentation.</p>
